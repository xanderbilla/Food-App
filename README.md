# E Commerce Web Application

The multi-e-commerce application is a comprehensive solution that encompasses four distinct apps: fashion web, food order, electronic e-commerce, and grocery apps. Each app operates independently, yet they are seamlessly integrated to provide users with a unified shopping experience.

The fashion web app serves as an online store for clothing and fashion accessories. It features product listings, detailed product information, and a shopping cart. Users can search, browse, and add items to their cart, and complete purchases using various payment methods.

## Lessons Learned

This project brings me a lot of oppertunity to learn new technology and frameworks such as React Js, Node Js and MongoDB/DynamoDB. I also learned more advance usage of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) Amplify Service that is implmenting backend.

I faced a lot of challenges such as wrtiting API and tetsing API. I overcome all the problems with the help of [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com) and [community Support](https://github.com/aws-amplify) of AWS.
